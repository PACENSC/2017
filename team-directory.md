Heading into the nationals season, they're undeniably the top team of Southern California, having only placed outside first at a single tournament when fielding a full team. They're both excited and anxious to make waves at the national level, having not gotten the opportunity to compete against other top high schools due to the geographic isolation of the SoCal circuit. But most importantly, the team, fielding 3 seniors who have competed with one another since 8th grade, hopes to finish off their career on a high note.
