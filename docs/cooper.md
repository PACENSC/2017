The [Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award](http://www.pace-nsc.org/2018-cooper-award-winners/)
is an annual award presented by PACE to recognize an individual or organization 
whose above-and-beyond contributions to the quizbowl community embody, by 
example, the ideals of academic competition. The original Cooper Award was named
in honor of Benjamin Cooper, a student at Georgetown Day School who had been 
named captain of his team prior to his untimely death on August 12, 1997. The 
Cooper Academic Ambassador Award has been awarded at every NSC since PACE’s 
founding. PACE is proud to present the 2019 Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador 
Award to the founders of the [Las Vegas Quiz Bowl Alliance](https://www.lvqba.org/) 
-- **Matt Albert, Justin Sharp, and Paul Villaluz** -- 
for their work starting a pyramidal quiz bowl 
circuit in the Las Vegas area.

In 2004, PACE added the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award, which
specifically recognizes the contributions of under the age of 25. Many winners of
the “Young Cooper” award were high school or college students at the time when
they were recognized.

PACE is proud to represent the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award to
**Connor Mayers** of Penn Manor HS, Millersville PA, for his outreach work in
expanding the high school and middle school circuits in Pennsylvania.
