title: Congratulations Cooper Award Recipients
---


The [Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award](http://www.pace-nsc.org/2017-cooper-award-winners/) is an annual award presented by PACE to recognize “a high school academic competition team member, advisor, or organization whose character best promotes the spirit and honor of quiz bowl competition”.  The original Cooper Award was named in honor of Benjamin Cooper, a student at Georgetown Day School who had been named captain of his team prior to his untimely death on August 12, 1997, and has been awarded at every NSC since PACE’s foundation.  In 2004, PACE added the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award, which specifically recognizes the contributions of persons under the age of 25. Many winners of the “Young Cooper” award are high school or college students at the time they are recognized. 

This year, PACE would like to recognize the following individuals for their work on expanding and improving high school quizbowl at the local and national levels.  

The winner of the 2017 Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award is Fred Morlan. We recognize his work on [HSQB Rank](https://hsqbrank.com/), assisting coaches and tournament directors in West Virginia and Kentucky, and spreading better quizbowl practices nationwide.

The winner of the 2017 Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award is [Jackie Wu](https://www.facebook.com/pacensc/posts/10155280149643048) of Downingtown High School East in Pennsylvania. We recognize her work to convert her school and others in her region to pyramidal quizbowl, including hosting multiple tournaments.

Congratulations to Fred and Jackie! We at PACE thank you for all your hard work building the high school quizbowl circuit.
